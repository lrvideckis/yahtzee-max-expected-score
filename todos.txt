2. implement multiple Yahtzees (each worth 100 points)
3. implement a GUI (similar to below website), and/or think of better way to do IO
4. add monte-carlo style test: test that average score of many rounds (playing optimally) gives 229.63850 points
5. still can make it run faster by playing around with dp-trick done during transitions
6. refactor/comment code to be more readable - include detailed description of approach
7. add file with interesting stats, ex: list of all possible starting rolls, sorted by expected value
8. nit: it runs in ~6 seconds on laptop, so update expected run time print statement to 4-7 seconds
